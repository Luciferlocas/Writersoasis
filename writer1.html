            <P>My name is Shubham, and I am a writer-cum-poet who finds solace in the beauty of words. Through my heartfelt verses, I strive to capture the essence of emotions and touch the souls of those who read my work. Writing has become an integral part of my life, allowing me to express my deepest thoughts and experiences in a way that resonates with others.

                Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Technology (B.Tech), and although my academic path may seem unrelated to my passion for writing, it has only served to enrich my perspective. The scientific and technical knowledge I acquire in my studies often finds its way into my poetry, creating a unique blend of logic and creativity.
                
                Balancing my studies and my passion for writing can be challenging, but it is a challenge I embrace wholeheartedly. My time at the university is filled with lectures, assignments, and examinations, but I always find a way to make room for my creative outlet. Writing becomes my sanctuary, a place where I can retreat and explore the depths of my imagination.
            </P>
